# Python GUI Shopping Cart
GUI verison of Python Shopping Cart [https://github.com/DariusSG/Sem1-Project]

## Objective
To develop a grocery ordering and payment system using Python  
Programming. The application allows users to order supermarket  
grocery items online. Customers can view the list of products by  
category, place orders, and view the final bill electronically using the  
application. 


## Specifications
The following are the required specifications:  

1. Grocery items should be categorized according to Table 1.  

2. When a user selects a category, it should show: every item in the category, price of each item (inclusive of 7% GST) and whether the item is on offer according to Table 1. The user can also specify the quantity to order (i.e., user can order more than one quantity of the same grocery item). The default quantity is one.  

3. The program should allow users to select multiple grocery items from various categories and add them to the “Shopping Cart”. Users can also remove an existing item if needed. After selection is done, the user will be presented with a summary list of currently selected items in shopping cart. Thereafter, the user will be presented with an option to check-out / make payment.  

4. During check-out / payment, the user should be prompted on whether he/she has a discount card. If the user has a discount card, there will be an additional discount of 10% off the total ordered amount. The user will be presented with a formatted bill with the summary of all ordered items and prices. The bill should also list the total price of items ordered, total discount (if applicable), GST amount and the final payable amount.  

6. Create a Menu System displaying the following options: list of grocery items according to category, list of grocery items in alphabetical order, list of items in ascending price, view items in shopping cart, remove an item from shopping cart, check-out/payment, and supermarket sales summary report.  
 
8. Dictionaries and Functions must be used in the program code.
